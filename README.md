Rock Paper Scissors Game is a console-based application built in C++ where the player competes against the computer.
The game allows multiple rounds (1â€“10), keeps track of wins, draws, and losses, and displays colorful results for each round and the final outcome.

It uses random number generation for computer moves, structs to organize game data, and enums for clean handling of choices and results.
At the end of the game, a detailed summary is shown with the winner highlighted.
